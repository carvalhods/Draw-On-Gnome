# CHANGELOG

This is a list of modifications I have made to the repository. 
I'm aiming to be able to track all changes in the case zhrexl (the original repo owner) resurfaces. Then we can merge everything back in (if necessary).

**November 3, 2024**
- Forked DrawOnYourScreen2 (all branches)
- Tested the fork for issues
- Created the GNOMEv46 branch for prosperity (that was the last known good version maintained by zhrexl)
- Created the GNOMEv47 branch to add commits from cryptbrn (and others) to be later merged into main branch (this is to be uploaded to G.E.O.)
- Created this changelog file
- Created backup directory for any files that I modify.

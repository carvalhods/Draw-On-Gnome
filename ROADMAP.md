# Roadmap and Todo for DOYS3

- [ ] Change name from Dock to Dash in pop up menu
- [ ] hover text for buttons in right-click menu
- [ ] Ctrl+O and Ctrl+Shift+O not cycling properly in v47
- [ ] Whiteboard option with one shortcut
- [ ] Menu mod: Shortcut key for Color picker to `Ctrl+0` no KP
- [ ] Smooth line fix
- [ ] Snap to grid feature
- [ ] Laser feature (Like Draw Pen), maybe a right-click and drag (like Owl Bear), or a new shortcut or something...
